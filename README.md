<h1><center>Sign Language Detection Project</center></h1>
<h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
<h3><p>This project aims to develop a sign language detection system using computer vision techniques. The system will be able to recognize and interpret sign language gestures captured via a camera feed in real-time. This README provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, requirements, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information.</p></h3>
Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Develop a computer vision model capable of accurately detecting and recognizing sign language gestures.</li>
<li>Implement real-time processing of camera feed to interpret gestures as they are performed.</li>
<li>Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.</li>
</ul>
<b><h1>Requirements</h1></b>
Python 3.x<br>
OpenCV<br>
TensorFlow <br>
NumPy<br>
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)<br>
Webcam or any camera device for capturing input.<br>
